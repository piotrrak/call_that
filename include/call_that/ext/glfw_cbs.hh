/*! @brief Sets the key callback.
 *
 *  This function sets the key callback of the specified window, which is called

 *
 *  The key functions deal with physical keys, with layout independent
 *  [key tokens](@ref keys) named after their values in the standard US keyboard
 *  layout.  If you want to input text, use the
 *  [character callback](@ref glfwSetCharCallback) instead.
 *
 *  When a window loses input focus, it will generate synthetic key release
 *  events for all pressed keys.  You can tell these events from user-generated
 *  events by the fact that the synthetic ones are generated after the focus
 *  loss event has been processed, i.e. after the
 *  [window focus callback](@ref glfwSetWindowFocusCallback) has been called.
 *
 *  The scancode of a key is specific to that platform or sometimes even to that
 *  machine.  Scancodes are intended to allow users to bind keys that don't have
 *  a GLFW key token.  Such keys have `key` set to `GLFW_KEY_UNKNOWN`, their
 *  state is not saved and so it cannot be queried with @ref glfwGetKey.
 *
 *  Sometimes GLFW needs to generate synthetic key events, in which case the
 *  scancode may be zero.

/*! @brief Sets the Unicode character callback.
 *
 *  This function sets the character callback of the specified window, which is

 *
 *  The character callback is intended for Unicode text input.  As it deals with
